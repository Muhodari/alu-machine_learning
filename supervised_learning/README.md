# Supervised Learning

This directory contains implementations of supervised learning algorithms and neural network components.

## Directory Structure

### classification/
Contains binary classification implementations using neural networks.

#### Files:
- `0-neuron.py` - Single neuron implementation for binary classification
- `README.md` - Detailed documentation for classification algorithms

## Overview

Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. This directory focuses on neural network-based approaches for classification tasks.

## Key Components

### Neural Networks
- **Single Neuron**: Basic building block for binary classification
- **Multi-layer Networks**: (Coming soon) More complex architectures for advanced classification tasks

### Classification Algorithms
- **Binary Classification**: Distinguishing between two classes
- **Multi-class Classification**: (Coming soon) Handling multiple classes

## Usage

Each subdirectory contains its own README with specific usage instructions and examples. Start with the classification directory for basic neural network implementations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- (Additional dependencies may be required for specific implementations)

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the specific algorithm directory (e.g., `classification/`)
2. Read the README file for detailed documentation
3. Run the example scripts to see the algorithms in action

## Future Additions

This directory will be expanded to include:
- Multi-layer neural networks
- Different activation functions
- Optimization algorithms (gradient descent, etc.)
- Regularization techniques
- Advanced classification algorithms
